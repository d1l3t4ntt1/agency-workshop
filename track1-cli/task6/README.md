# Track 1.1 - Task 6: ~Issue credential for verified information~

Our workshop tracks have the above task 6 subject: verified information. As you
did noticed in the task 4 we already achieved the email verification. Even it
was a pseudo-implementation, because we don't have the email sending endpoint
in the FSM language yet. We were able to simulate the PIN-code verification
thru the logging in this workshop, where two agents are controlled from the same
computer terminals.

Our actual task 6 subject will be...

# Task 6: Freestyling

Implement a issuing chatbot that uses credential definition that's bind to
schema which have multiple attributes: `name`, `gender`, `tel`, `email`. It's
totally up to you how long you want to go with issuing bot.

We would be extremely happy to hear your feedback.
