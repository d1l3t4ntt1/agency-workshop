# Track 1.1: CLI & Chatbot Application

In this track, you will learn how to build a chatbot application that utilizes
Findy Agency FSM language. The assumption is that you are working in a guided
workshop with the default tooling. In this case you can skip the sections with
symbol ðŸ¤ .

The workshop contains seven and Â½ tasks:

* [**Task 0: Setup environment**](#task-0-setup-environment)
* [Task 1: Create a new connection](./task1/README.md)
* [Task 2: Send greetings](./task2/README.md)
* [Task 2.5: Chatbot and FSM Language](./task2.5/README.md)
* [Task 3: Prepare for issuing credentials](./task3/README.md)
* [Task 4: Issue credential](./task4/README.md)
* [Task 5: Verify credential](./task5/README.md)
* [Task 6: ~Issue credential for verified information~](./task6/README.md)

Follow the instructions and execute the tasks in order. Good luck!
It's needed. Both, the CLI and the FSM chatbot language are still under
development.

**NOTE:** The workshop instructions are tested with Linux and MacOS. If you are using Windows,
you may encounter problems. In this case, it might be easiest to use
[a preconfigured environment](https://github.com/findy-network/agency-workshop-codespace)
powered by GitHub Codespaces.

## Task 0: Setup environment

### 0. Set Your `findy-network` Root Directory

We recommend you go to your workspace/project directory (~/Documents, etc.) and
execute following:

```shell
mkdir findy-network
cd findy-network
```

You can store this directory to environment variable now. It's important that
you can restore `FCLI_PATH` in every new terminal session that is used for these
tasks. We'll do that in [the chapter 4](#4-set-environment-variables)

```shell
export FCLI_PATH=`pwd`
```

> Tip. Copy then directory value and add it to your shell initialization scripts
> (`.bashrc`, or `.profile`, what's your poison) if you aren't going to use
> `direnv` tool.

##### Terminals environment summary

During this practise you will use two agents `$hello` and `$world`. During this
documentation we use following concepts and roles in chronological order:

| Agent  | Terminal | Role/Command  |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| $hello |  1       | `ping`, `listen`, `read`  |
| $world |  2       | `ping`, `connect`, `bot start`,  |
| $hello |  3       | `ping`, `bot chat` |

As a summary, there'll be 3 non-overlapping (ideal not mandatory) terminal
window where first two are for both agents. And finally we need third terminal
for the `$hello` agent when chatbot is in the game.

> For the long-running commands like `listen`, `read`, `chat` you can close them
> with `ctrl-C`, and `bot chat` with `ctr-D` because it's reading `stdin`.

### 1. Clone these repositories into your `$FCLI_PATH'

This in mandatory. It includes the CLI FSM playground BASH scripts, example
FSMs, and some optional documentation:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/findy-network/findy-agent-cli.git
```

As you noticed, you are cloning the `findy-agent-cli` repo as well to get *the
actual playground/helper scripts* for your use.

The scripts are located `scripts/fullstack/`. The directory contains `README.md`
where some of the scripts are documented. It presents few examples as well.

In the case, you want to read these transcripts from your own machine, or you
want to use native setup of Findy Agency, you might be interested to clone
`agency-workshop` repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/findy-network/agency-workshop.git
```

### 2. Install The Tooling

The prerequisites for the FSM track are:

1. You should have a Unix and terminal access. The shell can be whatever, but
  `bash` is preferred because it's mostly tested by the dev team.
2. You need following tools as well: `uuidgen`, `git`, `curl`, which most can be
   found from Unix systems.
3. We have installation guides and scripts for every OS and CPU architecture in
   [`findy-agent-cli`.](https://github.com/findy-network/findy-agent-cli#installation)
   To minimize hassling, we recommend you to use following lines for `findy-agent-cli`
   installation, which makes care of writing rights, `PATH`, and keeps you in
   control:

   ```shell
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/findy-network/findy-agent-cli/HEAD/install.sh -o install
    chmod +x ./install
    sudo BINDIR=/usr/local/bin ./install
    which findy-agent-cli
   ```

   When the final command outputs: `/usr/local/bin/which/findy-agent-cli` all is
   OK.
4. And most importantly, you should have access to [Findy
   Agency](https://findy-network.github.io). After CLI is successfully installed
   you need to setup it's execution environment, i.e. bind it to the Findy Agency.
   You'll get the Findy Agency URL for workshop organizer.

Everything presented here can be executed just by using `findy-agent-cli` (later
just `$FCLI`) and Unix terminal & shell. (Terminal multiplexers and tiling window
managers might help you during these tasks.)

### 3. ðŸ¤  Install Findy Agency

If you are participating in a guided workshop, you will likely have a cloud
installation of Findy Agency available. Skip this step.

Start local agency instance if you do not have cloud installation available.
See instructions [here](../agency-local/README.md).

### 4. Set environment variables

The agency environment provides a script for setting up the needed environment
variables automatically.

Run following script in the terminal, or maybe not, but run the block after that
because there seems to quite many shell that don't understand `sourc <()`
notation:

```shell
source <(curl <agency_url>/set-env-cli.sh)
```

This is the safes and most backward compatible way to install environment
variables for our Findy Agency playground:

```shell
curl <agency_url>/set-env-cli.sh -o set-env-cli.sh
source ./set-env-cli.sh
```

As already said, **The agency URL is provided for you in the guided workshop**,
e.g. `https://agency.example.com`. If not, ask it from the organizer.

The script will export the needed environment variables. It will also create
file `.envrc` that contains these variables. Typing `direnv allow` will ensure
that the variables are automatically exported when you open a new terminal
window in this folder.

If you don't have `direnv` installed, you can export the variables by typing
`source .envrc`. **Note. This is important:** all the following CLI FSM tasks
relay the environment variables defined in `.envrc`, which means that if you
aren't using `direnv` you must `source .envrc` every new `CLI playground`
terminal.

Before `.envrc` is ready for FSM playground use, **we must add a couple
variables to it**. First move to `findy-network` root directory:

```shell
cd $FCLI_PATH
```

and then add the variables. Note. If `direnv` is in use, it asks you to `direnv
allow` after below command. Please do so:

```shell
printf 'export FCLI_CONFIG=./cfg.yaml\nexport FCLI_PATH=%s\n' "`pwd`" >> .envrc
echo "alias pf='printenv|grep FCLI|sort'" >> .envrc
```

> Tip. Now you have also a `pf` alias which is handy to check that you playground
> environment is OK.

**If you don't use `direnv` tool, you must remember do the following for each
new terminal session:**

```shell
cd $FCLI_PATH
```

Load environment variables manually for the Findy Agent CLI when in the
`findy-network` root directory:

```shell
source .envrc
```

<summary>ðŸ¤  Local setup (WebServer&docker)</summary>

For [local agency
installation](https://github.com/findy-network/findy-wallet-pwa/blob/master/tools/env/README.md#agency-setup-for-local-development),
use the web wallet URL `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
source <(curl http://localhost:3000/set-env-cli.sh)
```

<details>
<summary>ðŸ¤  Local setup (Native from sources)</summary>

You need to have Go 1.20 installed to run needed Agency services from sources:
**but you don't need docker or network access**.

In the case you want to play with the sources or you want to get touch of how the
whole system feels to run locally from sources,
see instructions [here](../agency-native/README.md). There is a script
(`setup.sh`) which installs all the needed repos and a tmuxinator script to start
the system playground. The script targets a Debian Linux.

Here's the summary what should be done:

Clone the needed Agency service source repos:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/findy-network/findy-agent-auth.git
git clone https://github.com/findy-network/findy-agent.git
git clone https://github.com/findy-network/findy-agent-cli.git
```

Start the FIDO2 Server:

```shell
cd <findy-agent-auth-repo>
cd scripts; ./mem-dev-server.sh
```

Start the Agency Core Server:

```shell
cd <findy-agent-repo>
make cli
cd scripts/test
fa ledger steward create --config create-steward-to-mem-ledger.yaml
agency=fa register=findy.json no_clean=1 enclave=MEMORY_enclave.bolt ./mem-server --reset-register --grpc-cert-path ../../grpc/cert
```

Start the Findy Agent CLI to command your local agency (in a new terminal/window/tab):

```shell
cd <findy-agent-cli-repo>
make cli
cd scripts/fullstack
source ./setup-cli-env-local.sh
admin/register && . admin/login
cli agency count
```

After you have verified that everything above works, you can allocate two
separate SSI agents:

```shell
# continue in findy-agent-cli/scripts/fullstack 
./make-play-agent.sh test-alice test-bob
pushd test-alice
cli agent ping
# do something else with `test-alice` and `test-bob` like:
cd $(./invitation | ../test-bob/connect)
cli connection trustping
popd
./rm-play-agent.sh test-alice test-bob
# typically you shutdown FIDO2 and Core servers at this point
# like (tmux kill-session)
```

If you want to use tmux and tmuxinator the previously mentioned `setup.sh`
script includes tmuxinator configuration that is installed by it with the name
`play`.

```shell
tmuxinator play
```

Tip:
> You can use tmuxinator configurations even when using cloud version of the
> agency. Just check from where the environment variables are loaded.
