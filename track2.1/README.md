# Track 2.1: Typescript application

In this track, you will learn how to build a Typescript application that utilizes Findy Agency API
for issuing and verifying credentials. Follow the instructions carefully and
execute the tasks in order. Good luck!

## Task 0: Setup environment

1. **Clone this repository** to your workspace:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/findy-network/agency-demo.git
    ```

1. **Install tooling**

    The recommended tooling for the Typescript track is to use
    [the Dev Container feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) in VS Code.

    For **the recommended tooling**, you need to have the following:
      * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
      * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

    If you wish to avoid VS Code and Dev Containers, you need to have the following tools available natively:
      * Code editor of your choice
      * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro))
      * [findy-agent-cli](https://github.com/findy-network/findy-agent-cli#installation)
      * [direnv](https://direnv.net/) (*optional*)

1. Install Findy Agency (*optional*)

    If you are participating in a guided workshop,
    you will likely have a cloud installation of Findy Agency available. Skip this step.

    Otherwise, start local agency instance. See instructions [here](../agency-local/README.md).
