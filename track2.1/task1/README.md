# Track 2.1 - Task 1: Create and greet your new connection

An agent's primary capability is peer-to-peer messaging, which allows for exchanging messages
between agents. These interactions can range from simple plaintext messages to more complex tasks
such as negotiating the issuance of a credential or presenting proof. The peer-to-peer
messaging mechanism is called DIDComm, which is short for DID communication and operates based
on the exchange and use of DIDs.

Establishing a DIDComm connection requires one agent to generate an invitation and
transfer the invitation to the other agent. Typically the invitation is displayed as a QR code
that the other agent can read using a mobile device. The connection negotiation can then begin using
the information in the invitation. Eventually, the agents have a secure, e2e-encrypted
communication pipeline that they can use to transmit other protocol messages.
