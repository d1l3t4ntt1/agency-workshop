# Agency Workshop

## Introduction

Welcome to [Findy Agency](https://findy-network.github.io) Workshop! This workshop is for those
who wish to learn how to build
applications that utilize verifiable credentials through the Findy Agency platform.

During the workshop, you will learn

1. how to **setup the development environment** for your Findy Agency client,
2. how your **client can onboard** and authenticate to the agency,
3. how your client can **create pairwise invitations and connect** to other agents,
4. how your client can *issue credentials* to other agents, and
5. how your client can *verify credentials* presented by other agents.

This repository contains all of the needed material for the workshop.
You can do the workshop at your own pace, either in a guided workshop session
or independently in your own time.
